## Proposal

Making video games and learning Clojure
by Lisa Passing
Making video games is lots of fun and frustrating at times, and so can learning Clojure be. So why not combine both for maximum effect?

I started making video games a few years ago in JavaScript and Lua as a learning playground and for fun. Later I started learning Clojure on the side after attending a ClojureBridge workshop. When I tried making games in Clojure, sort of convinced that my experience in one would help with the other, I didnâ€™t know what I would get myself into.

This is a talk about my experiences along the way.
